**What is Azure DevOps?**

Azure DevOps is a cloud-based DevOps platform that **streamlines software development and delivery** by integrating automation, collaboration, and CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment).

**Key Features of Azure DevOps:**

**â€¢	End-to-End Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Automation**

**â€¢	Integrated CI/CD Pipelines** for automated testing and deployment

**â€¢	Scalable Source Code Management** with Azure Repos

**â€¢	Agile Planning and Tracking** using Azure Boards

**â€¢	Secure and Reliable Artifact Management** with Azure Artifacts

**â€¢	Test Management and Quality Assurance** via Azure Test Plans

By using Azure DevOps, organizations can **reduce manual efforts, accelerate software releases, and improve overall efficiency.**

---

**Why Learn Azure DevOps?**

DevOps is a **critical skill** for software engineers, cloud engineers, and DevOps professionals. Learning Azure DevOps is beneficial because:

**1.	High Demand in the Industry:** Many organizations adopt Azure DevOps for its seamless **integration with Microsoft Azure and other cloud services.**

**2.	Centralized DevOps Platform:** It eliminates the need for multiple tools like **Jenkins, GitLab, Jira, and Artifactory** by offering an all-in-one solution.

**3.	Better Collaboration & Productivity:** Teams can **plan, develop, test, and deploy** applications from a single interface.

**4.	Robust Security & Compliance:** Azure DevOps integrates **security and governance** best practices, reducing vulnerabilities.

**5.	Cost-Efficient:** It reduces **infrastructure and tool management costs** by providing a **fully managed DevOps solution.**

**Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

Every organization follows a **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, which consists of:

**1.	Planning & Requirement Analysis** â€“ Identifying features, gathering requirements, and setting timelines.

**2.	Design Phase** â€“ Creating **high-level architecture (HLD) and low-level design (LLD)** for the application.

**3.	Development** â€“ Writing and committing code to a **version control system.**

**4.	Testing** â€“ Ensuring functionality, security, and performance using **automated and manual tests.**

**5.	Deployment** â€“ Releasing the application into **staging/production environments.**

**6.	Monitoring & Maintenance** â€“ Continuously tracking performance, security, and **scalability** of the application.

Without automation, this process can take months, but **Azure DevOps accelerates each phase by providing specialized services.**

---

**Core Services of Azure DevOps**

Azure DevOps consists of **five primary services** that cover each phase of the SDLC.

**1. Azure Boards (Planning & Tracking)**

Azure Boards is a **work tracking system** that helps teams plan and manage their projects using Agile, Scrum, or Kanban methodologies.

âœ… **Use Cases:**

**â€¢	Project planning** with user stories, tasks, and epics

**â€¢	Sprint management** for Agile teams

**â€¢	Issue tracking** and bug reporting

**â€¢	Integration with GitHub and Azure Repos** for seamless development tracking

ðŸ’¡ Example: A development team working on a new iOS feature can use Azure Boards to manage **tasks, sprint planning, and backlog refinement.**

---

**2. Azure Repos (Source Code Management)**

Azure Repos provides **Git-based source control**, enabling teams to **collaborate, track changes, and version their code.**

âœ… **Use Cases:**

**â€¢	Git repository hosting** for secure code storage

**â€¢	Branching and merging strategies** for better code collaboration

**â€¢	Pull request workflows** for **code reviews and approvals**

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A DevOps Engineer can store **Terraform scripts, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD pipeline configurations** in Azure Repos.

---

**3. Azure Pipelines (CI/CD Automation)**

Azure Pipelines is a **CI/CD service** that enables **automated build, test, and deployment** of applications.

âœ… **Use Cases:**

**â€¢	CI/CD pipeline automation** for rapid software delivery

**â€¢	Automated testing** integration for quality assurance

**â€¢	Multi-cloud deployments** (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**â€¢	Support for multiple programming languages** (Python, Java, .NET, etc.)

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**

A DevOps team can configure an Azure Pipeline that **automatically builds, tests, and deploys** an application whenever code is pushed to the repository.

```sh
trigger:
  - main

jobs:
  - job: Build
    steps:
      - task: UseDotNet@2
        inputs:
          packageType: 'sdk'
          version: '6.x'

  - job: Deploy
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploying application..."
      - task: AzureWebApp@1
        inputs:
          azureSubscription: 'MyAzureSubscription'
          appName: 'my-web-app'
```

**4. Azure Test Plans (Quality Assurance)**

Azure Test Plans provides **test management capabilities**, allowing QA teams to create, execute, and track test cases.

âœ… **Use Cases:**

**â€¢	Manual & automated test execution**

**â€¢	Defect tracking and reporting**

**â€¢	Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing**

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A **QA team** can create test plans in Azure Test Plans and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines to **automatically validate application changes.**

---

**5. Azure Artifacts (Package Management)**

Azure Artifacts **stores and manages software packages** (such as **Maven, NuGet, npm, and Python** packages) for easy reuse.

âœ… **Use Cases:**

**â€¢	Hosting internal libraries and dependencies**

**â€¢	Managing package versions** across multiple projects

**â€¢	Securing software dependencies**

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A Java development team can use Azure Artifacts to **store and manage JAR files** for consistent dependency management.
