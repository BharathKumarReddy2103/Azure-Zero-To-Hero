# Azure Storage Services

## What is Azure Storage?
Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution that offers durable, scalable, and secure data storage options. It supports structured and unstructured data, providing different storage types to meet various needs, such as Blob, File Table, Queue storage.

## Key Features of Azure Storage
- **Durability & Availability:** Data is replicated across multiple locations to ensure high availability.
- **Scalability:** Supports massive amounts of data with the ability to scale automatically.
- **Security:** Provides encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and private endpoints.
- **Data Redundancy Options:** LRS, ZRS, GRS, and RA-GRS.
- **Cost-Effective:** Pay-as-you-go pricing with different storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive).

## Types of Azure Storage Services

Azure provides four primary storage types:

### 1. Azure Blob Storage (Object Storage)
- Used for storing unstructured data such as images, videos, and backups.
- Supports different access tiers: **Hot, Cool, and Archive**.
- Ideal for big data analytics, backup & disaster recovery, and media streaming.

#### How to Create Azure Blob Storage

1. Go to Azure Portal → Storage Accounts → Create.
2. Select Subscription, Resource Group, and enter a unique Storage Account Name.
3. Choose Region, Performance Tier (Standard/Premium), and Replication Type (LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS).
4. Click "Next: Advanced" → Enable Blob public access if needed.
5. Click "Review + Create" → Create.
6. Once deployed, navigate to Containers → Create a Container → Upload files.

**Example from DevOps Engineer point of view**

**A DevOps Engineer can use Azure Blob Storage to store:**

Application logs generated by microservices running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Docker images, Terraform state files, and Helm charts as part of CI/CD Pipelines.

Backup and archival of build artifacts for compliance purposes.

**Use Case in DevOps:**

Store CI/CD pipeline logs for debugging.

Maintain Terraform state files for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Upload large data files for Big Data processing in Azure Databricks.

**2. Azure Files (File Storage - SMB & NFS)**

Fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via SMB or NFS.
Can be mounted by multiple virtual machines (VMs).
Supports Azure File Sync for hybrid cloud storage.

**How to Create Azure Files Storage**

1. Go to Azure Portal → Storage Account → File Shares.
2. Click "+ File Share", enter a Name and select a Quota.
3. Click "Create".
4. Once created, click "Connect" → Use the provided PowerShell or CLI script to mount the file share.

**Example from DevOps Engineer point of view**

**A DevOps Engineer can use Azure Files for:**

Storing shared configuration files that need to be accessed by multiple virtual machines (VMs).

Mounting shared network drives for Kubernetes Pods in AKS.

Persistent storage for legacy applications running on Azure VMs.

**Use Case in DevOps:**

Provide shared storage for an Nginx or Apache Web Server cluster.

Store Jenkins job configurations in a shared file system.

Store Ansible playbooks or Helm charts that need to be shared across teams.
   
**3. Azure Table Storage (NoSQL Key-Value Store)**
   
A NoSQL key-value store for structured, non-relational data.
Suitable for storing large-scale structured data like logs and IoT data.

**How to Create Azure Table Storage**

1. Go to Azure Portal → Storage Account → Tables.
2. Click "+ Table", enter a Table Name, and click "OK".
3. Use Azure Storage Explorer or Azure SDKs to add, update, and query data.

**Example from DevOps Engineer point of view**

**A DevOps Engineer can use Azure Table Storage for:**

Storing logging and monitoring data from application services.

Keeping metadata for infrastructure automation.

Storing cost and usage tracking data for infrastructure resources.

**Use Case in DevOps:**

Use Azure Table Storage to store non-relational log data from Azure Functions.
Maintain a cost tracking database for different Azure resources.
Store feature flags for dynamic application configuration in Kubernetes.
   
**4. Azure Queue Storage (Message Queue Service)**

Stores and processes messages asynchronously in a queue.
Helps in decoupling application components.

**How to Create Azure Queue Storage**

1. Go to Azure Portal → Storage Account → Queues.
2. Click "+ Queue", enter a Queue Name, and click "Create".
3. Use Azure SDKs or REST API to send and receive messages from the queue.

**Example from DevOps Engineer point of view**

**A DevOps Engineer can use Azure Queue Storage for:**

Implementing event-driven automation in CI/CD pipelines.

Queueing messages between microservices in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Managing asynchronous task execution in a distributed environment.

**Use Case in DevOps:**

Use Azure Queue Storage to queue logs before sending them to Azure Monitor.

Queue failed CI/CD jobs for retry without manual intervention.

Decouple components of a serverless application in Azure Functions.

**Azure Storage Access Tiers**

**Hot Tier:** Frequently accessed data.

**Cool Tier:** Infrequently accessed data but still needs quick access.

**Archive Tier:** Rarely accessed data, stored for long-term retention.

**Best Practices for Azure Storage**

Use Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies to move data between tiers.
Enable soft delete to protect against accidental deletions.
Implement encryption at rest and in transit for data security.
Optimize performance and cost by choosing the right storage type.
