**Monitoring in Azure**

**Introduction**

Monitoring is a crucial aspect of maintaining a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure. As a **DevOps Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**, understanding how to build an **effective monitoring system** on **Azure** is essential.

This guide provides a structured approach to **Azure monitoring**, covering:

â€¢	The key **roles and responsibilities** of a DevOps Engineer in monitoring

â€¢	Understanding **what to monitor** beyond just CPU and memory

**â€¢	Best practices for monitoring Azure-based workloads**

â€¢	Tools and services available for **effective monitoring in Azure**

**â€¢	Real-world use cases and examples** to build a robust monitoring system

By the end of this guide, you will have a **clear roadmap** to implement an **end-to-end monitoring strategy** on Azure, ensuring **high availability, performance, and security** of your cloud applications.

**Why Monitoring is More Than Just CPU and Memory?**

Many engineers assume monitoring involves only checking **CPU and memory utilization** of nodes and applications. However, real-world **monitoring involves multiple layers.**

For instance, in an enterprise using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, multiple components affect application performance:

**â€¢	Network components** (Virtual Networks, Firewalls, Load Balancers)

**â€¢	Control Plane components** (API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager)

**â€¢	Data Plane components** (Nodes, Pods, Containers)

**â€¢	Application Performance** (Response times, Latency, Error rates)

**â€¢	Storage and Infrastructure** (Blob storage, Virtual Machines, Serverless functions)

An effective monitoring system should track **all these layers** to identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, and **proactively prevent failures.**

**Understanding Azure-Based Monitoring: A Practical Example**

**Scenario: Monitoring an Enterprise Application on Azure**

Consider an organization, **Example.com**, which hosts its **entire infrastructure on Azure.**

**â€¢	Compute:** The application runs on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

**â€¢	Storage:** Uses **Azure Blob Storage** for storing files

**â€¢	Networking:** Configured with **Azure Virtual Networks (VNet), Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Firewalls**

**â€¢	Monitoring Requirement:** Ensure **high availability, optimal performance, and proactive issue detection**

To achieve this, we need a **multi-layered monitoring approach.**

**6 Levels of Monitoring in Azure**

A well-structured **Azure monitoring strategy** can be broken down into **six levels:**

**Level 1: Network Traffic & Components Monitoring**

â€¢	Monitor **firewalls, virtual networks, web application firewalls (WAFs), and NSGs**

â€¢	Detect **latency issues, dropped packets, and security threats**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Azure Network Watcher

**Level 2: Node & Node Pool Monitoring (Compute)**

â€¢	Track **CPU, memory usage, disk IO, and resource saturation**

â€¢	Ensure **node availability and autoscaling efficiency**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Prometheus (Managed Azure Service)

**Level 3: Kubernetes Control Plane Monitoring**

â€¢	Check **API Server response times, etcd health, and Kubernetes scheduler efficiency**

â€¢	Identify issues in **managed control plane services**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Azure Monitor â€“ Container Insights

**Level 4: Workload Monitoring (Pods & Containers)**

â€¢	Track **pod restarts, crash loops, and container performance**

â€¢	Monitor **ReplicaSets, deployments, and container resource limits**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Prometheus + Grafana

**Level 5: Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

â€¢	Monitor **latency, error rates, database performance, and request tracing**

â€¢	Optimize **queries, caching, and API response times**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Azure Application Insights

**Level 6: Storage & Additional Azure Services Monitoring**

â€¢	Monitor **Azure Blob Storage, Virtual Machines, and Serverless functions**

â€¢	Ensure **data integrity, access patterns, and backup status**

**â€¢	Best tool:** Azure Monitor

**Choosing the Right Monitoring Tools in Azure**

Can **one tool monitor everything?** Yes, but **not effectively.** The best approach is to use **specialized tools** for different layers:

---
| **Monitoring Area**          | **Recommended Tool**                        | **Use Case**                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Monitoring**       | [Azure Network Watcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/) | Track network latency, firewalls, NSGs |
| **Node & VM Monitoring**     | [Prometheus (Managed)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitor/essentials/prometheus-overview) | Monitor CPU, memory, disk IO of nodes |
| **Kubernetes Control Plane** | [Azure Monitor â€“ Container Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) | Track API Server, etcd, scheduler health |
| **Pod & Container Monitoring** | [Prometheus + Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) | Monitor pod restarts, container memory usage |
| **Application Performance**  | [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) | Monitor error rates, response times, APM |
| **Storage & Infra Monitoring** | [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/) | Monitor VMs, Blob Storage, Azure Functions |

**Azure Monitor: The Centralized Monitoring Solution**

Azure Monitor integrates with **various Azure services** and collects **metrics, logs, traces**, and **alerts** to help teams **visualize and analyze** system performance.

**Key Features of Azure Monitor**

**â€¢	Data Collection:** Gathers logs, metrics, traces from Azure services

**â€¢	Analysis & Insights:** Provides recommendations on **performance optimizations**

**â€¢	Visualization:** Integrates with **Grafana, Power BI, and Azure Dashboards**

**â€¢	Automated Alerts:** Sends **Slack, Email, or Teams notifications**

**Example: Setting Up Azure Monitor for AKS**

```sh
az aks enable-addons --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --name MyAKSCluster --addons monitoring \
  --workspace-resource-id /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/{workspace-name}
```
