**Azure Networking Interview Questions and Answers**

Here is a comprehensive list of Azure Networking interview questions categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. These questions will help you prepare for Azure DevOps roles.

**Basic Level Questions**

1. What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?

   Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental networking layer in Azure. It enables you to create a private network 
   within the Azure cloud and securely connect Azure resources to each other or to on-premises environments.
  
2. What is the purpose of a Subnet in Azure VNet?

   Subnets divide a VNet into smaller IP address spaces, enabling better traffic management and resource isolation within a 
   VNet.
   
3. What is CIDR, and how is it used in Azure Networking?

   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses. In Azure, it is used to define the address 
   space of VNets and subnets.
   
4. What is the difference between Azure VNet and On-Premises Network?

   Azure VNet is a software-defined network in the cloud, while on-premises networks are physical and managed locally. Azure 
   VNets provide scalability, global reach, and integration with Azure services.

5. What is Network Security Group (NSG)?

   NSGs are firewall-like rules applied to subnets or VMs in a VNet to allow or deny inbound/outbound traffic based on 
   port, protocol, or IP address.
   
**Intermediate Level Questions**

1. What are Azure Availability Zones, and how do they differ from Regions?

   Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within a region. They provide fault isolation, whereas regions 
   are geographically distributed.

2. Explain Azure VNet Peering and its benefits.

   VNet Peering connects two VNets, allowing them to communicate. Benefits include low latency, high throughput, and cost- 
   effectiveness compared to VPN Gateways.

3. What is an Application Gateway in Azure?

   Azure Application Gateway is a Layer 7 load balancer that manages application-level traffic. It supports SSL 
   termination, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and URL-based routing.

4. What is the difference between Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager?

   Azure Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 and distributes traffic within a region, while Azure Traffic Manager operates at 
   DNS level to route traffic across regions.
  
5. What is Azure VPN Gateway, and how is it different from Azure ExpressRoute?

   Azure VPN Gateway provides secure site-to-site or point-to-site connections using IPsec and IKE. ExpressRoute is a 
   dedicated, private connection between Azure and on-premises environments for faster and more reliable connectivity.
   
6. What is Azure Firewall, and how does it differ from NSG?

   Azure Firewall is a managed network security service that protects resources at the VNet level. NSG, on the other hand, 
   is used for controlling traffic at the subnet or VM level.
   
7. How does Azure DNS work?

   Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by mapping domain names to IP addresses 
   using Azure's global network.
  
8. What is a Route Table in Azure Networking?

   A Route Table contains routes that define the flow of network traffic. Custom routes can override Azure's default system 
   routes for traffic control.
   
**Advanced Level Questions**

1. What is the difference between Public IP and Private IP in Azure Networking?

   Public IP addresses are accessible over the internet, while private IP addresses are used for communication within the 
   VNet.
   
2. What is VNet Gateway, and how is it different from a VPN Gateway?

   VNet Gateway refers to the gateway resource in Azure that enables VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute configurations. VPN 
   Gateway specifically supports secure tunneling using protocols like IPsec/IKE.
   
3. How does Azure implement High Availability in VNets?

   High availability is implemented using Availability Sets, Zones, Load Balancers, and redundant components across 
   multiple datacenters.
   
4. Explain the concept of Azure Virtual Network Service Endpoints.

   Service Endpoints extend the VNet's private IP space to Azure services, enabling secure, direct connectivity without 
   public internet exposure.
   
5. What is the difference between VNet Peering and VNet-to-VNet VPN?

  VNet Peering connects VNets within the same or different regions over Microsoft's backbone network. VNet-to-VNet VPN uses 
  a VPN Gateway and is slower and less cost-effective.
  
6. What is a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)?

   An NVA is a virtual appliance, such as a firewall or router, deployed in Azure for advanced network functions like 
   packet inspection and filtering.
   
7. How do Azure Virtual Network NAT Gateways work?

  NAT Gateway provides outbound internet connectivity for VMs in a VNet without needing public IP addresses.
  
8. What are the key differences between Azure Application Gateway and Azure Front Door?

   Azure Application Gateway is a regional Layer 7 load balancer, while Azure Front Door is a global service designed for 
   optimizing web application delivery.
   
9. Explain how Azure supports Disaster Recovery with VNets.

   Azure leverages region pairing, replication, and services like Azure Site Recovery to ensure disaster recovery for VNets 
   and associated resources.
   
10. What is VNet Integration, and where is it used?

    VNet Integration allows Azure App Services to communicate securely with VNets. It is typically used for connecting web 
    apps to backend services in a VNet.
    
**Practical/Scenario-Based Questions**

1. How do you connect two VNets across different regions?

   Use VNet Peering for low latency or VPN Gateway for secure site-to-site communication.
   
2. How would you secure a VNet with inbound and outbound traffic rules?

   Apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to subnets and associate Route Tables with custom routes for controlling traffic 
   flow.
   
3. You need to deploy a web app accessible globally with a WAF. How would you achieve this?

   Use Azure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) and integrate it with Traffic Manager or Azure Front 
   Door for global traffic distribution.
   
4. How would you implement Auto-Scaling for VMs in Azure Networking?

   Use VM Scale Sets with Load Balancer or Application Gateway to scale VMs automatically based on demand.
