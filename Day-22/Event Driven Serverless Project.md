**What is Serverless Architecture?**

Despite its name, **serverless computing** does not mean there are no servers. Instead, it means:

â€¢	Servers are **created dynamically** when needed.

â€¢	You are **only charged for execution time,** not for idle compute power.

â€¢	Cloud providers handle **scaling, provisioning, and maintenance.**

**Why Use Serverless?**

Consider a **Java application** that connects to a **MySQL database.** If the app is rarely accessed (e.g., 10 API calls per day), running it on a **24/7 virtual machine (VM)** is wasteful. Instead, **serverless functions** execute only when an API request is received, eliminating unnecessary costs.

**Serverless vs Virtual Machines**

| Feature           | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Serverless (Azure Functions) |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Billing**      | 24/7 charges         | Pay-per-execution         |
| **Scaling**     | Manual or auto-scaling | Auto-scales dynamically  |
| **Management**  | Requires updates, monitoring | Fully managed by Azure  |
| **Use Cases**   | Continuous workloads  | Event-driven workloads   |

**Serverless Use Case: Automating File Processing in Azure Blob Storage**

**Problem Statement**

A **DevOps Engineer** needs to monitor **Azure Blob Storage** for uploaded files. If a file **larger than 1GB** is uploaded, the system should:

**1.	Send a notification** to users.

**2.	Automatically compress** or delete large files.

**Solution: Azure Functions with Blob Storage Trigger**

Instead of using a **VM** to constantly monitor uploads, we can use **Azure Functions** to **trigger actions automatically** when a file is uploaded to Blob Storage.

**Setting Up an Azure Function for Event-Driven Automation**

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

â€¢	An **Azure Subscription** (Free Tier or Pay-as-you-Go)

**â€¢	Azure CLI installed** (**Download Here**) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

â€¢	A **GitHub Repository** to store scripts (optional)

**Step 1: Create an Azure Function App**

We use **Azure CLI** to automate resource creation. Run the following **Bash script** to create:

â€¢	A **Resource Group**

â€¢	A **Storage Account**

â€¢	An **Azure Function App**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="serverless-rg"
STORAGE_ACCOUNT="serverlessstorage$(openssl rand -hex 3)"
FUNCTION_APP="serverless-app$(openssl rand -hex 3)"
LOCATION="eastus"

# Create Resource Group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION

# Create Storage Account
az storage account create --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --location $LOCATION --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --sku Standard_LRS

# Create Function App
az functionapp create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --consumption-plan-location $LOCATION --runtime python --runtime-version 3.9 --functions-version 4 --name $FUNCTION_APP --storage-account $STORAGE_ACCOUNT
```

**Note:** The openssl rand -hex 3 ensures unique names to avoid conflicts.

**Step 2: Create a Blob Storage Trigger Function**

**1.	Go to the Azure Portal** and navigate to your Function App.

**2.	Click on **"Create a Function" â†’ "Develop in Portal".**

**3.	Choose **"Blob Storage Trigger"** as the event trigger.

**4.	Set the **path** to monitor Blob Storage uploads:

```sh
samples-workitems/{name}
```
5.	Click **"Create".**

---

**Step 3: Modify the Function Code**

By default, Azure generates a basic **Python function** to log uploaded file details. Modify it to **check file size** and **take action:**

```sh
import logging
import os
import azure.functions as func

def main(myblob: func.InputStream):
    file_size = myblob.length
    file_name = myblob.name

    logging.info(f"File uploaded: {file_name}, Size: {file_size} bytes")

    if file_size >= 1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024:  # 1GB threshold
        logging.warning(f"Large file detected: {file_name} ({file_size} bytes)")
        # Take action: Delete, compress, or notify user
```

---

**Step 4: Upload a Test File to Trigger the Function**

**1.**	Go to **Azure Storage Account â†’ Containers.**

**2.**	Create a **new container**: samples-workitems.

**3.**	Upload a **test file** (e.g., large-file.txt).

**Expected Output in Azure Monitor:**

```sh
File uploaded: large-file.txt, Size: 1.2GB
Large file detected: large-file.txt (1.2GB)
```

**Best Practices for Serverless in DevOps**

**1.	Optimize Costs**

o	Use **consumption-based pricing** (avoid always-on configurations).

o	Reduce **cold starts** by keeping functions lightweight.

**2.	Implement Security**

o	Use **managed identities** for authentication.

o	Restrict function **access controls** using **Azure RBAC.**

**3.	Monitor Performance**

o	Enable **Application Insights** for logs and metrics.

o	Set up **alerts** for failed executions.

**4.	Use Asynchronous Processing**

o	For long-running tasks, use **Azure Queue Storage** to queue events.

o	Avoid excessive execution time in **serverless functions.**

**Real-World Use Cases for DevOps Engineers**

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **File Processing** | Trigger **compression, validation, or alerts** when files are uploaded. |
| **Log Processing** | Ingest logs into **Azure Monitor** or forward to **SIEM solutions**. |
| **CI/CD Automation** | Trigger **build and deployment pipelines** from events (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD). |
| **Chatbot/Webhooks** | Process **Slack notifications**, auto-respond to API events, etc. |
| **Cost Optimization** | **Scale down resources** when traffic is low, **delete old backups** automatically. |

**Conclusion**

Serverless computing provides a **cost-effective and scalable** solution for event-driven architectures. Azure Functions allow DevOps teams to automate workflows, optimize cloud spending, and build **real-time event-driven applications.**

**Next Steps**

**â€¢	Enhance the function:** Implement **file compression** instead of deletion.

**â€¢	Deploy via CI/CD:** Automate Azure Function deployment with **GitHub Actions.**

**â€¢	Monitor logs:** Use **Azure Application Insights** for real-time logging.
